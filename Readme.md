# EDA Python Mini Project - Group 8

## 📘 Project Overview

This project performs Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a dataset using Python. The goal is to uncover patterns, spot anomalies, test hypotheses, and check assumptions with the help of summary statistics and graphical representations.

## 📂 Dataset

The dataset used in this project includes:
- Customer demographic and transaction information
- Categorical and numerical features

## 🧰 Tools and Libraries

- Python (Pandas, NumPy)
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook

## 🔍 Key Analysis Performed

- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Univariate and bivariate analysis
- Outlier detection
- Correlation heatmap
- Visualization with plots (boxplot, histogram, scatter, etc.)

## 📊 Insights

- Identified key variables influencing the outcome
- Visualized relationships between categorical and numerical variables
- Summarized data distributions and trends

## 📎 How to Run

1. Open the `.ipynb` notebook or `.html` report in Jupyter or a web browser.
2. Ensure required libraries are installed.
3. Follow the code cells for step-by-step analysis.

## 👨‍👩‍👧‍👦 Team

This project was created by Group 8 as part of the Python mini project requirement.
